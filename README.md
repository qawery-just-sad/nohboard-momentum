# nohboard-momentum
It's not a good copy of Momentum Mod layout that displays pressed keys

## Install guide:
1. If you don't have it already get [latest NohBoard](https://github.com/ThoNohT/NohBoard/releases)
2. Put `Momentum` folder (which contains `images` and `Momentum` folders) into `NohBoard-1.X.X/keyboards/`
3. Launch NohBoard -> right click -> Load Keyboard -> Category (Pick Momentum)
4. Keyboard Definition: (right now there is only Momentum but i'll make an extended version with turn binds and save locks)
5. Keyboard Style: I think it should be obvious at this point to which option you should use (no it is not "global:default")
6. PROFIT $$$$
